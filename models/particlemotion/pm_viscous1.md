# Overview 

The Particle Motion in a Viscous Field 

# Physics Notes 

[N1] The motion in a viscous environment directly relates 
- Force 
-- Endogenous, i.e. Particle Initial Force 
-- Hexogenous, i.e. Forcefield 
- Velocity

## Introduction 

### Definition 

A set of introductive definition is presented 

[D1] Assume the "Container Space" to be an Euclidean d dimensional space 

[D2] Assume a "Particle" as a metarial point with 
- "Particle Position" 
- "Particle Velocity" 
  - Defined as the time derivative of the Position 


[D3] Assume a "Forcefield" as a function associating to each point of the "Container Space" a "Force Vector" 

[D4] Assume the motion to happen in a viscous mean 

### Dynamic 

[Dyn1] The Dynamic Equation is defined as 
- Left Side = "Particle's Velocity Vector" 
- Right Side = Local "Forcefield" Vector
