# Overview 

The Particle Motion in a Viscous Field 

# Physics Notes 

[N1] The motion in a viscous environment directly relates 
- Force 
  - Endogenous, i.e. Particle Initial Force 
  - Hexogenous, i.e. Forcefield 
- Velocity

## Introduction 

### Definition 

A set of introductive definition is presented 

#### Container Space 

[D_CS1] Assume the "Container Space" to be an Euclidean d dimensional space 

[D_CS2] Assume the motion to happen in a viscous mean 

#### Particle 

[D_P1] Assume a "Particle" as a metarial point with 
- "Particle Position" 
- "Particle Velocity" 
  - Defined as the time derivative of the Position 


#### Forces 

[D_FF1] Assume a "Forcefield" as a function associating 
- each point of the "Container Space" 
- to "Force Vector" 



### Dynamic 

[Dyn1] The Dynamic Equation is defined as 
- Left Side = "Particle's Velocity Vector" 
- Right Side = Local "Forcefield" Vector
